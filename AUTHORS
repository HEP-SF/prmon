Rolf Seuster wrote the original code that used SMAPS information
to calculate properly the memory shared between processes (to enable
calculation of the PSS, or Proportional Set Size).

Nathalie Rauschmayr used that to develop one of the first versions
used for production.

Tony Limosani added the code to measure I/O stats, as part of the
ATLAS Athena offline software stack.

Graeme A Stewart refactored the code to make the utility stand alone,
renamed it as prmon (from MemoryMonitor) and is working on further
enhancements.

Alaettin Serhan Mete added the code to measure timing stats (CPU/wall) 
and is working on further enhancements.
