# Prmon Authors

- Graeme A Stewart refactored the code to make the utility stand alone,
renamed it as prmon (from MemoryMonitor) and worked on many further
enhancements.

- Alaettin Serhan Mete added the code to measure timing stats (CPU/wall) 
and worked on many additional improvements.

*Graeme and Serhan* continue to maintain prmon today.
